# preliminary considerations
Begin with an introduction that explains the purpose of the questionnaire and how the information will be used.

Use open-ended questions to allow respondents to express their needs and wishes in their own words. For example, "What are some things you wish your city did better?" or "What would make your city more livable?"

Include some specific questions that target key aspects of a smart city, such as transportation, public safety, energy efficiency, or community engagement.

Consider using rating scales to help respondents provide more specific feedback. For example, you could ask respondents to rate the importance of different smart city features on a scale of 1 to 5.

Keep the questionnaire short and focused, with no more than 10-15 questions.

After you have drafted the questionnaire, try it out on a few people to get feedback on its clarity and effectiveness. This will help you refine the questionnaire before distributing it to your target audience.

Consider using an online survey tool to make it easier to collect and analyze the data.
