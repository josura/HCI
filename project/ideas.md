- Walking and the metro is the preferred way of traveling in the city (the people that have submitted the questionnaire all come from Italian cities, mainly Catania, Torino, and Bologna)
- Waste management in the city is ok but some people have commented on how the residents do not respect the rules in place for waste management
- energy consumption and efficiency are relevant but not in the minds of the commoner, so the possible solutions for smart city integration should be done by the government to reduce the overall consumption of the city and the residents without making them feel the difference
- Traffic controls are not respected by the people in these cities, and pedestrians or people without cars are often endangered in some way. The same thing could be said about safety in the city in general.
- High-speed internet is fundamental but available in the cities where the people that have taken the questionnaire are living
- Some people would like to find a way to connect and engage in the community

I have some ideas about these problems, and these are 
- Implement smart crosswalks that detect when a pedestrian is about to cross and automatically adjust traffic signals to stop cars and allow safe crossing. The system could also use computer vision to detect pedestrians and alert drivers when someone is about to cross.
=> interesting ... But it is maybe more a AI problem than a HCI one...
- Use computer vision to monitor and analyze traffic patterns and adjust traffic signals in real-time to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. The system could also detect and alert authorities to accidents, not respecting the rules, or other incidents on the road.
=> interesting!
- Develop a smart waste management system that uses AI to optimize garbage collection routes and schedules based on real-time data on waste levels and traffic conditions. The system could also use machine learning to predict future waste levels and adjust collection schedules accordingly.
=> interesting... But it is maybe more a AI problem than a HCI one...
- Install solar panels on city-owned buildings and facilities to generate renewable energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The city could also develop a smart grid that integrates renewable energy sources and optimizes energy distribution and consumption based on real-time data. (I also have kind of worked on something similar for a European proposal, but this system is more engineering than computer science itself so I do not know)
=> maybe a little out of topic...
- Implement a smart lighting system that uses sensors to detect when a room or area is empty and automatically adjusts lighting levels to reduce energy consumption. The system could also use AI to learn occupancy patterns and adjust lighting schedules accordingly.
=> interesting... But... are there explicit human-computer interactions?...

I have also some ideas to incorporate the last problem (engagement of the population in social activities) with some smart city ideas:
- Develop a smart city app that provides information on local events and activities, as well as recommendations based on the user's preferences and location. The app could also facilitate social connections by allowing users to connect with others who share similar interests. (this is similar to what I have proposed during the various exercises about the W3OUT system, so I will probably take some elements of this idea for the project)
=> interesting!
- Develop a smart community platform that connects residents with local businesses, organizations, and government agencies. The platform could allow residents to provide feedback, make suggestions, and get involved in decision-making processes. (This is also similar to what I have done for a European project)


=> interesting!


- Use smart transportation systems to encourage social interaction and community engagement. For example, the city could develop shared transportation services that encourage residents to ride together and get to know each other.


=> interesting!


- Create a smart city program that encourages residents to participate in community-building activities, such as volunteer work or neighborhood clean-up events. The program could provide incentives or rewards for participation and could use technology to track and measure participation rates.


=> interesting!

I will decide on the project to do after some feedback and also if some are more interesting than others for the project and beyond(like the smart city program to encourage residents with an app maybe to do some social work and control performance and participation rates with computer vision, AI, and data analysis, all developed with HCI in mind and a combination of the best points of each solution).
